## 2024-05-24 - Expensive Derived State in Render Body
**Learning:** Derived state calculations (like array filtering/sorting) placed directly in the component body run on *every* render, even when irrelevant state changes (like switching tabs).
**Action:** Always wrap expensive derived calculations (filtering, sorting, aggregations) in `useMemo` to ensure they only run when their dependencies change. This is especially critical in components with many independent state variables (tabs, inputs, etc).
